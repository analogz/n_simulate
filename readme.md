#n_simulate
Welcome to n_simulate. This repository contains compiled `python` code that enables collaborators to develop classical and quantum simulations for the programmable nanophotonic processor (or quantum photonic processor).

You won't find instructions for using these libraries here. Email n_h@mit.edu for instructions.
