Welcome to n_simulate. This repository contains compiled `python` code that enables collaborators of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Quantum Photonics Laboratory to develop classical and quantum simulations for the programmable nanophotonic processor (or quantum photonic processor).

You won't find instructions for using these libraries here. Email n_h@mit.edu and englund@mit.edu for instructions.
